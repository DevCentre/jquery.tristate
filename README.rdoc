Overview
========

I needed a tri-state checkbox for a client's project and didn't find
much on the web that I thought was suitable.  The one at
http://shamsmi.blogspot.com/2008/12/tri-state-checkbox-using-javascript.html
was close, but the Javascript was unnecessarily complex (although he
may have been trying to avoid framework dependencies).  As far as I'm
concerned, jQuery *is* Javascript.

I have shamelessly stolen the images in Shamsmi's package and wrote
this simple plugin.
